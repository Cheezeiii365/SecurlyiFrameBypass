# unblock-survivio
This is a GitHub repo that uses an iframe to bypass a Chrome extension that blocks games and other cool stuff. My fellow students are particulary fond of Surviv.io, but the extension blocked the websites for it. Some websites worked, but fullscreen didn't work.
<br>
The solution? Make something that can bypass it.

*So I did.*

# *This may not work if your school has a filter or firewall that blocks games. (aka IP blocking)*

## This will not work with devices that use the Securly VPN, such as iPads and iPhones.
This will, however, work with the Chrome extension. It’s made for the extension and tested on the extension, so if your device doesn’t have it, it may not work. It's optimized for Chromebooks, since that's what I tested it on. It should work with all other devices with the extension though.
