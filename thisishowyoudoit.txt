How did I do it???

well, it’s simple.

it’s just an iframe.

that’s all it is.

go look at the source code.

TLDR: look at example.html and replace example.com with another website.

it’s an iframe that automatically changes to your browsers’s width and accesses surviv.io indirectly.
most school website blockers just block direct connections to websites (securly was the one my school used) but not iframes.
this takes advantage of this and lets you play surviv.
the iframe also has a property that lets it go fullscreen, which is why you can do that and not on other websites.
this may also work with other online games too. if you want, you can fork it through GitHub and edit the url it accesses.
its free to use and fork.

i may make a video explaining this later.
